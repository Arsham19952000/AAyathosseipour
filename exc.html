    <h2>1. Place of birth</h2>
    <p>He was born in 1978 in the city of Rumeshkan, a part of Lorestan province, to a family with an average financial situation.
It could be said that he was born in the midst of war and spent many years of his childhood in fear of war.</p>

    <h2>2. Education</h2>
    
    <p>He started studying in a small school and spent his school years with not very good grades, but according to himself (he has not yet renewed). 
Let's go. After spending 12 years of school, he received his diploma, but unfortunately he did not strive for higher qualifications and success.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>3. Marriage</h2>
    <p>>There is no information available from his 20s to 30s, but we can say that after he turned 30, his life changed. 
It was at the time of marriage. A sentence he said to his mother, and then they went to propose to a girl named Elham for him, and after a while they got married.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>4. Starting a family</h2>
    <p>>A year after her marriage, he had a beautiful and charming son named Arsham. Whatever I say about his beauty is not enough, he was so beautiful
that all his relatives were infatuated with him. Arsham was five years old when a daughter was born and Arsham had a sister!</p>
